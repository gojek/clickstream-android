Clickstream is an event agnostic, real-time data ingestion platform. Clickstream allows apps to maintain a long-running connection to send data in real-time.

The word “Clickstream” is a trail of digital breadcrumbs left by users as they click their way through a website or mobile app. It is loaded with valuable customer information for businesses and its analysis and usage has emerged as a powerful data source.

**To know more about Clickstream, you can read our [Medium post](https://www.gojek.io/blog/introducing-clickstream?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=medium%20blog&utm_campaign=blog_clickstream)**

**Clickstream provides an end to end solution for event ingestion. For setting up the backend infrastructure please check out [raccoon](https://odpf.gitbook.io/raccoon/)**

## Key features

-   Simple and lightweight
-   Remotely Configurable
-   Support for real-time data
-   Multiple QoS support (QoS0 and QoS1)
-   Typesafe and reusable schemas
-   Efficient payloads
-   In-built data aggregation

### Getting Started with Clickstream

1. Add the maven repository URL to the root `build.gradle` of your project.

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

2. Add the following dependencies to your module `build.gradle`

```kotlin
dependencies {
    val version = "x.y.z"
    implementation 'com.gojek.clickstream:clickstream-android:[latest_version]'
}
```

3. Add the following rule in proguard.pro or dexguard-project.txt

```
-keep class * extends com.google.protobuf.GeneratedMessageLite { *; }
```

Once you’ve added the dependencies and synchronized your Gradle project, the next step is to initialize Clickstream.

### Initialization

Initialization of the Clickstream can be done on the background thread or main-thread,
Invocation should be done on the Application class. So that the initialization happens only once.

To create a Clickstream instance you can do the following setup:

```kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        initClickStream()
    }

    private fun initClickStream() {
        ClickStream.initialize(
            configuration = CSConfiguration.Builder(
                context = context,
                info = CSInfo(
                    appInfo = appInfo,
                    locationInfo = locationInfo,
                    deviceInfo = csDeviceInfo,
                    customerInfo = customerInfo,
                    sessionInfo = sessionInfo
                ),
                config = getBuildConfig(config)
            ).apply {
                setLogLevel(DEBUG)
                setCSSocketConnectionListener(connectionListener())
            }.build())
    }

    /**
    * @see [CSConnectionEvent] for more detail explanation
    */
    private fun onConnectionListener(): CSSocketConnectionListener {
        return object : CSSocketConnectionListener {
            override fun onEventChanged(event: CSConnectionEvent) {
                is OnConnectionConnecting -> {}
                is OnConnectionConnected -> {}
                is OnMessageReceived -> {}
                is OnConnectionClosing -> {}
                is OnConnectionClosed -> {}
                is OnConnectionFailed -> {}
 			}
    	}
    }
}
```


### Configuration

#### CSEventSchedulerConfig

Holds the configurations for Clickstream. These constraints allow for fine-grained control over the library behaviour like duration between retries, flush events when app goes in background, etc.

|  Description | Variable | Type |	Default value |
|--|--|--|--|
| Number of events to combine in a single request | eventsPerBatch | Int | 20 |
| Delay between two requests (in millis) | batchPeriod | Long | 10000 |
| Flag for enabling forced flushing of events | flushOnBackground | Boolean | false |
| Wait time after which socket gets disconnected | connectionTerminationTimerWaitTimeInMillis | Long | 5000 |
| Flag for enabling flushing of events by background task | backgroundTaskEnabled | Boolean	| false |
| Initial delay for background task (in hour) | workRequestDelayInHr | Long | 1 |

#### CSNetworkConfig
Holds the configuration for network related. e.g configure timeouts for network channel.

|  Description|  Variable |	Type |	Default value |
|--|--|--|--|
|  Endpoint for web socket server | endPoint | String | No Default Value |
|  Connect timeout to be used by okhttp (in seconds) | connectTimeout | Long | 10 |
|  Read timeout to be used by okhttp (in seconds) | readTimeout | Long | 10 |
|  Write timeout to be used by okhttp (in seconds) | writeTimeout | Long | 10 |
|  Interval between pings initiated by client (in seconds) | pingInterval | Long | 1 |
|  Initial retry duration to be used for retry backoff strategy (in milliseconds) | initialRetryDurationInMs | Long | 1000 |
|  Maximum retry duration for retry backoff strategy (in milliseconds) | maxConnectionRetryDurationInMs | Long | 6000 |
|  Maximum retries per batch request | maxRetriesPerBatch | Long | 20 |
|  Maximum timeout for a request to receive Ack (in milliseconds) | maxRequestAckTimeout | Long | 10000 |
|  OkHttpClient instance that passed from client | okHttpClient | OkHttpClient | No Default Value |

#### CSEventClassification
Holds the class name to be classify into InstantEvent (QoS) or RealtimeEvent (QoS1).

|  Description |  Variable | Type |	Default value |
|--|--|--|--|
|  Holds all the eventTypes | eventTypes |	EventClassifier | [EventClassifier(identifier: "realTime", eventNames: []), EventClassifier(identifier: "instant", eventNames: [])]|

### Cleanup
Destroy instance of Clickstream, for example can be called when user logs out of the app.

```kotlin
   ClickStream.release()
```

### Push an Event

#### Using Explicit Builder

As Clickstream use a proto definition on the client-side, you can build a MessageLite and send it directly through ClickstreamSDK.

For instance, you’ve defined a proto definition called `Rating.java` which has the following properties

```
rating: Float
reason: String
```

Thus we can build the rating object just by using a Builder Pattern.

```kotlin
val event = Rating.newBuilder()
    .setRating(4.5)
    .setReason("nice!")
    .build()

// wrap event in CSEvent
val csEvent = CSEvent(
    guid = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    timestamp = Timestamp.getDefaultInstance(),
    message = event
)

// track the event
ClickStream.getInstance().trackEvent(csEvent)
```

Congratulations! You’re done!.

#### Running Sample App
